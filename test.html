<h4>Let’s dream a little this week</h4><p>First off, this is not a whistle-blowing scam, so don’t hold back!</p><p>You know, it’s funny how we complain about not having enough money and ironically, when we are actually given enough money, we don’t know what to do with it!</p><p>And we know the first thing on your mind is to disappear with it, but let’s actually analyze this for a bit.</p><p>Here are seven things you can actually do with 30 billion in your account as you are, like this…</p><ol><li><strong>Send 25,000 kids to good secondary schools in Lagos for the entire 6 years!</strong></li></ol><p>The average school fees paid in Lagos is NGN200,000, pere!

<h4>For those of us who don’t have any choice but to WIN</h4><p>If we could, we’d come find you. Wherever you are. And give you a hug. And listen to what you’re going through. And let you know that for real, you’ll be okay. You’ve got this.</p><p>We don’t have the answers, nor can we predict your future. What we do have are these open arms, and words to help you get through it. We’ve been in it ourselves. To be honest, with this economy, we’re in it. But you know what, we’ll make it. If any of these is you…</p><p><strong>1. Mummy Dearest</strong></p><p>Mummy, you sold your gold and hollandaise wrappers because you wouldn’t let your kids who are doing well at school become drop outs. Mummy. Thank you. From us to you: You’ll be okay. You’ve got this.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/488/1*XVHuABEs78Qp6boFh5EjNw.gif" /></figure><blockquote>Anything for her</blockquote><p><strong>2. The Friend that’s Closer than a Brother</strong></p><p>You’re both in school. His parents can’t send him pocket money. You too, you’re managing your own, but you can’t see a friend suffering, so you’re splitting the small that you have. Don’t worry, your story will be epic. You’ll look back on these tough days with fondness.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*fOjvofuxsY-xdr8w_4bQ-w.gif" /></figure><blockquote>through it all</blockquote><p><strong>3. Papa, my Papa</strong></p><p>Dad, you sold your okada for your son to get a shot at that opportunity of a lifetime. But he didn’t get it. Again. Your boy is downcast. You’ve done the best you can do. Papa, he knows you love him.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*imDWxlmTI2LkwXTxj0T1Uw.png" /></figure><blockquote>For this, thank you. That alone is worth more than all else.</blockquote><p><strong>4. Brotherly </strong><br>You couldn’t get a job so you decided to do one small business. It’s hard but you are all your younger sister has. That’s why you keep going and you’ll do anything to keep her smiling. You’ll be okay bro; you’ve got this.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*ImXNfqUPFIxmyu1cH-vw3w.gif" /></figure><blockquote>keep at it</blockquote><p><strong>5. Nothing to Show</strong></p><p>You’ve worked what 10 years now? You always nearly have that promotion but you always never have it. What’s to show for the hard work you’ve put in. Love, you’ll be okay; you’ve got this.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/268/1*tpLy-r6m55Ji3bdAsDD0SA.gif" /></figure><blockquote>It’ll be okay</blockquote><p><strong>6. If Wishes were Horses</strong></p><p>Your whole life is in your laptop. You hear about people who sprayed 50K at the club but all you need is just 15K to repair the flex problem so you can put food on your table. You’ll be okay; you’ve got this.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/460/1*kr4CmwbAl5bMdXLpn9I0YA.gif" /></figure><blockquote>You will tower over your problems</blockquote><p>Your story does not define who you’ll become. Keep shooting for the moon baby, even if you miss, you’ll still be shining among the stars.</p><p>Love, The<a href="http://findreach.com/"> REACH</a> Team</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=948b6fa32f6e" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-reach-chronicles/youll-be-okay-you-ve-got-this-948b6fa32f6e">You’ll Be Okay; You’ve Got This</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-reach-chronicles">The REACH Chronicles</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<h4>What to do, how to do it, and to whom</h4><p>Adulting is just the worst! You’re there. Minding your business…Suddenly! Life hits you. Small thing momsi will start announcing your age asking you to find work or finally bring home the bae. <a href="http://findreach.com">REACH</a> is here to help.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/1*yVJZtdEvsxI5yXi4Fq-aFA.jpeg" /></figure><p>And as if that isn’t hard enough, you now have to deal with all sorts of characters in this thing called life! Let’s quickly take a look at things to do to help you survive this scam called adulthood.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Chill. Out.</strong></p><p>Because somebody is growing up, I cannot drink Fanta. I cannot eat shaki. I cannot enjoy life. Gluten-free. Dairy-free. Sugar-free. Enjoyment-free sef.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/1*9AmoUVAE3BYfvXC8pWjkMg.gif" /></figure><p>Just let me have my one bar of chocolate in peace. Smh.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Defend your boundaries.</strong></p><p>Friends: Hey bro, we’re all going out this evening and are taking suggestions.</p><p>Your response:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/1*BXrQiWwKRZqt5-FQ0xwpNQ.jpeg" /></figure><p>Friends: Somebody cannot play with you again?</p><p>You: It’s time I learned to go to my house, catch up on sleep. Rest. For once.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Avoid the Alakobas (Ask your correct Yoruba friend to translate)</strong></p><p>Let’s be honest. You know people like this. From wahala to kasala. It’s like the moment you start making plans with them…</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/588/1*fL21c4W1s-Tnmbavk7mU5Q.png" /></figure><blockquote><em>Before their bad luck starts affecting your good will….</em></blockquote><p>But don’t be a fair-weather friend sha. Just have boundaries and use sense.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Run from Bills</strong></p><p>You: Gen, food, light, transport, bae, clothes and food on only me? Haba!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/450/1*kibvrQQcYZ-bJsH3wot4xw.gif" /></figure><blockquote>Can’t touch dis!</blockquote><p><strong>Step 5: That Bimpe, She Does Not Wish You Well</strong></p><p>Bimpe, we know you have fine face. Your looks have gotten you through life. It’s been working for you and seems unlikely to stop. You have found our mumu button but you know what? Not today, satan!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*aXuiMC_qKYLVOjc8XeD4Gg.gif" /></figure><blockquote>Me that I’m just managing myself here</blockquote><p>That’s all folks!

<h4>More salacious scoops on the fiscal infidelities of Lagos Big Madams</h4><p>I moved to Lagos from Nairobi in early 2016 to join my husband, who got a huge offer from a huge multinational company. Huge enough to take us out of our home country. This change came with a whole lot of upgrades. Yes. We had ‘fika’ad’ (arrived for those Nigerians reading this).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/268/1*Cq7qZzzq-ceUpuzHaCXtbw.gif" /></figure><p>I’d heard quite a bit about Nigeria — the giant of Africa; home to the most zealous and prolific hustlers you could ever find; slay factory extraordinaire; competitive even. Those stories were nothing in comparison to the shocking experiences to come.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/360/1*DMTy2Bhg5mf99vNaWNPq1w.gif" /></figure><blockquote>Yes, you’ll need to sit down for this.</blockquote><p>Given my husband’s high rank, we lived in the luxurious Lekki neighborhood — home to the ogas and madams of lore. Our next-door neighbor was one such sweet gal who quickly introduced me to her crew of classy Lekki wives. Finally! I had a girl squad!!!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/1*18n3YkPYhZlhGHZPUsjkCg.gif" /></figure><p>Little did I know that this was the devil’s way of laying a snare for my ugali-loving Kenyan soul.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/365/1*V0ji6JV4NzCBNJoB38sx3g.gif" /></figure><ol><li><strong>The Aso-ebi Palava</strong></li></ol><p>It started innocently enough. The daughter of one of the girls was getting married. As a show of friendship and solidarity, we’d all wear the same fabric. Mother of the bride selected a fabric that was 80,000 Naira. I thought nothing of it until I converted to shillings.</p><blockquote>Hold on! KES 26,000 just for fabric!?</blockquote><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/437/1*FXDLsFs5J9Gx580hgHjIPQ.gif" /></figure><blockquote>This must be a lie</blockquote><p>Alas, new to this town, I couldn’t back out now. So I paid up and shut up.</p><p><strong>2. The Money Carpet</strong></p><p>Now time for the reception and my people, there was money on the ground everywhere. Money in naira, dollars, pounds, euros. 4 large bags when all was done. My face?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/500/1*4CnIVX3amGahT8ibBAQbmA.gif" /></figure><blockquote>For real!</blockquote><p><strong>3. The Principles of Real Estate</strong></p><p>A few weeks later, the ladies invited me out to lunch. Then they start pointing at houses they own. My Kenyan people, these are “infidelity taxes” — houses purchased by their husbands each time they are caught cheating!</p><blockquote>“number 1 for the office bae, number 2 for the nanny, number 3 for another sister who came for job interview and so on and so forth!”</blockquote><p>And she says<em> “As far as he pays, me I don’t mind”</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/480/1*v1OySAg52xNhJCa6CxKoFw.gif" /></figure><p>How very cosmopolitan of them!</p><p><strong>4. The Fashion Attraction</strong></p><p>School is in session, hubby is off for several weeks of work travel. So one of the wives suggests I join her this year for Paris Fashion Week — private jet and all — after which Monsieur Francois will ensure there are ‘boys to play with us’.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/245/1*g4oppqCMmc99TCoeh3ydSA.gif" /></figure><blockquote>That’s when I got the hell outta there. Not today, Satan.</blockquote><p><strong>5. The Big Man Syndrome</strong></p><p>And finally, all her other friends are snobs!. This particular one was truly a bore. You must ‘package’ and go to the extent of buying things on credit just to get noticed. That means designer clothes, foreign weaves, fancy gadgets, fancy accent and fancy cars.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/203/1*wNxbZMzqeJWxFjk0M0tlRg.gif" /></figure><blockquote>Is it too late to go back to Kenya?(Justin Bieber voice)</blockquote><p>I quickly joined the service team at my church and I’ve learned a very useful new phrase. “I cannot come and go and die to be among.”</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/394/1*VPfR8Q9IFHh1W0TpikbQKA.png" /></figure><blockquote>Mercy said no</blockquote><p>If you need help in wisely managing your personal resources, before it gets swept off by these vices, download the REACH Savings app on <a href="http://www.findreach.com">www.findreach.com</a> to help you plan and save your money.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=e278cead122" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://medium.com/the-reach-chronicles/monetary-immorality-and-the-real-housewives-of-gbese-pt-2-e278cead122">Monetary Immorality and The Real Housewives of Gbese: Part 2</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/the-reach-chronicles">The REACH Chronicles</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
